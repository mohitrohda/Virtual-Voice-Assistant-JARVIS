## üîë API Keys Setup

1. **OpenAI API Key**  
   Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and generate an API key. Replace the key in `main.py` and `client.py`:
   ```python
   openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
   ```

2. **NewsAPI Key**  
   Get an API key from [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) and insert it in `main.py`:
   ```python
   newsapi = "your-newsapi-key"
   ```

3. **Music Library Setup**  
   Update `musicLibrary.py` with a dictionary like:
   ```python
   music = {
       "believer": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc",
       "faded": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ItHLz5WEA"
   }
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

- It listens for the wake word **"Jarvis"**
- On activation, it accepts the next voice command and responds accordingly

---

## üí° Sample Commands

- "Jarvis" ‚Üí activates the assistant  
- "Open Google"  
- "Play believer"  
- "What's the news?"  
- "What is coding?" (uses OpenAI)  

---

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

- Make sure your microphone works and is not in use by another app.
- If `pyaudio` installation fails, use `pipwin` as mentioned.
- The internet is required for OpenAI, NewsAPI, and Google speech recognition.
